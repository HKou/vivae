\section{Experiment Design}

This section describes how to design a new experiment scenario and how to load it into the \vivae .
The experimental scenario is saved in an SVG \cite{FIXME} file, that is loaded by \method{arena.loadScenario(String svgFilename)} function. The \method{loadScenario(String svgFilename)} function opens the SVG file and tries to construct all aobject according to the SVG label specified ofr the particular graphics element. The SVG file can be created by e.g. Inkscape \cite{FIXME}
